# @effectful/cc

Runtime library for multi-prompt delimited continuations with
[EffectfulJS](https://github.com/awto/effectfuljs).

[API documentation](api/README.md)

## Description

It is the most generic effects API implementation, and it can be
converted into any other one. These include JavaScript built-in
effects - state, async/await, generators, exception, etc.

Delimited continuations effect is also, probably, the most complex to
understand. I'm trying to explain it using exceptions analogy here. It
is like an exception, with execution may be resumed from `throw` point
several times.

This library is multi-prompt one. Prompt is a kind of a label. Imagine
JavaScript has labeled `try-catch` and `throw` statements. The label
is specified as another argument of `throw` and only `catch` block
with the same label catches it. All the others just rethrow to their
upper level. In the library the prompt(label) function is created
using `CC.newPrompt` function.

Function `CC.pushPrompt` is a replacement of `try` block. Its first
argument is a prompt object (specifying which exceptions) to catch,
and the second argument is a `try` body where an exception (with same
prompt) may raise.  Note, there is no `catch` block, it is specified
with `throw` replacement.

The `throw` replacement is `CC.withSubCont`.  Its first argument is a
prompt object again, specifying which `CC.pushPrompt` should catch
it. If there are a few `CC.pushPrompt` with the same prompt, the
innermost will be selected. The second argument is a `catch`
block. Unlike `try-catch` where the block is adjunct of `try`
statement, here it is specified along with `throw` replacement. Also,
there is no exception object.

The catch block is a function taking continuation object. It captures
execution path from `CC.withSubCont` (`throw`) to `CC.pushPrompt`
(`try`). In JavaScript exceptions, it is simply dropped. This object
allows resuming execution from the `CC.withSubCont` (`throw`) several
times.

If the captured continuation never executed the library works
precisely like exceptions. First executes `catch` block and continues
after `try` if the `catch` block doesn't throw anything else.

The continuation object received in `CC.withSubCont` may be called
anywhere using `CC.pushSubCont` function. Its first argument is the
continuation object captured in `CC.withSubCont`.

When `CC.withSubCont` is called, like for `throw` statement, the
execution control is suspended (aborted). When `CC.pushSubCont` is
called the execution is resumed with a resulting value of
`CC.withSubCont` on the resume is a result of the second argument of
`CC.pushSubCont`.

After the resumed execution control reaches `CC.pushPrompt` (`try`
statement), if not interrupted by anything else, it continues from the
`CC.pushSubCont` call. The call result is a result of `CC.pushPrompt`
block.

These four functions are the base. The others are defined using them.

When resuming continuations several times, if they change some
variable values, the change is visible on next run by
default. However, the continuation object may be cloned in whatever
way your program needs (shallow/deep) to restore variables
values. Alternatively, it may be Proxy based copy-on-write for better
performance.

The continuations are serializable using [@effectful/serialization](../serialization/).

Why do we need the other libraries if this library is the more
generic? Becuase of performance, no indirection layer, and another
effects API may be inlined.  The compiler is also able to derive more
efficient combinators, for example, implicit parallelism (Applicative
function API).

## Usage

### babel plugin

For single level syntax and activating by import:

```
$ npm install --save @effectful/cc
```

In .babelrc:

For two-level syntax with `async/await` overloading:

```json
{
  "plugins": "@effectful/cc/transform-async-do"
}
```

Or

```
$ babel --plugins @effectful/cc/transform-async-do index.js
```

In JS files to transpile:

```javascript
import * as CC from "@effectful/cc"
```

or

```javascript
var CC = require("@effectful/cc")

```

All async functions in files with the imports will be transpiled into delimited
continuations functions.

### Zero configuration transform

Zero-configuration using
[babel-plugin-macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros),
or any other tool where it is enabled by default (such as 
[Create Reat App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) since v2).

Import corresponding macro definition in the module to transpile:

```javascript

import "@effectful/cc/async-do.macro"

```

### List of available profiles

EffectfulJS offers quite a few options, there are groups of them called
profiles.  Different profiles may be enabled either by calling pre-processing
function `CC.profile("name")` in code, or using corresponding babel plugin or
macros.

 * "asyncDo" - transpile
    only async functions treating await expression as effectful expressions
    mark - double levels syntax. Babel plugin module is "@effectful/cc/transform-async-do" 
    and macro module is "@effectful/cc/async-do.macro" 
 * "defaultFull" - transpiles all sub-functions treating all function calls as effectful. 
    It is a single level syntax. Babel plugin module is "@effectful/cc/transform-full" 
    and macro module is "@effectful/cc/full.macro".
 * "defaultMinimal" - transpiles all functions but considers as effectful only
    expressions wrapped with imported namespace call , e.g. `CC(expr)`. Babel plugin
    module is "@effectful/cc/transform-minimal" and macro module is
    "@effectful/cc/minimal.macro".
 * "disabled" - nothing is transpilied, use compile time directives to specify
   needed profiles in the code.  Babel plugin module is "@effectful/cc/transform" and
   macro module is "@effectful/cc/macro".

For example, here is a module switching different profiles but nothing enabled
by default:

```javascript
import CC from "@effectful/cc"
import "@effectful/cc/macro"

// not transpiled
function notEffectful() {
}

CC.profile("defaultFull")

// transpiled, both `something and `somethingElse` are effectful
function effectful() {
  return something() + somethingElse()
}

CC.profile("minimal")

// transpiled, only `somethingElse` is effectful
function effectful() {
  return something() + CC(somethingElse)
}

CC.profile("disabled")

// not transpiled
async function justAsyncFunction() {
  await something
}

CC.profile("asyncDo")

// transpiled, only `somethingElse` is effectful
async function effectful() {
  return something() + await somethingElse
}
```

To get effectful value in single-level mode use `CC.reify` function.
